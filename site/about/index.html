                                Josek Cat begins with just a few common joseki to get you started - adding your own is the whole point!
                                <br><br>
                                Enter moves and an optional comment, then hit save. Your new joseki will appear in practice sessions, and the comment will be displayed once it is completed. 
                                <br><br>
                                You can click existing joseki in the menu below to edit them, toggle them on/off in practice sessions, or remove them.
                                <br> <br>
                                Joseki can be created in named groups, and each group can be toggled on/off in practice sessions. This allows you to practice just the groups you'd like to focus on.
                                <br> <br>
                                All joseki are automatically mirrored, rotated, and played by both colors during pratice sessions - no need to manually enter these variations.
                                <br><br>
                                Lastly, setup stones let you set the board to a position before your joseki, for more complex studies!

                                <p>If you're like me, you can't remember a joseki the first time you learn it in a lecture or a game review. I wanted a place I could write down the joseki, fuseki, and other patterns I "should" know. Wouldn't it be great if that list also helped you practice, too?</p>

                                <p>The other tools I found for practicing joseki had pre-made libraries that were full of variations I hadn't learned, and didn't want to understand yet. So I created Joseki Cat to practice just the joseki I wanted. Hopefully it helps you too!</p>

                                <p>Remember, just memorizing joseki isn't that helpful!</p>
                                <p>I suggest entering joseki you learn (and understand!) from lectures, books, and reviews. Put useful information in the comments about when you might use the joseki.</p>

                                <p>Then, do practice sessions in Joseki Cat in order to make sure they stay fresh in your mind.</p>

                                <p>If you find that your sessions are nearly 100% correct, it's probably time to add some new joseki to your repertoire!</p>
